        <h2 class="mb-3">1. Craft a Targeted Resume for Each Role</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters</strong><br>
            Hiring managers instantly recognize a generalized resume. When your resume speaks directly to the role and company, you demonstrate that you've done your homework and understand what they need.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How to Do It</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mirror job description keywords</strong> in your resume. For instance, if the posting emphasizes "project management skills," highlight your experience managing cross-functional teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Emphasize measurable achievements</strong> rather than vague responsibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Use an AI-driven platform</strong> like ResuSpark-where you input your resume details once, and it tailors the content to each unique job posting.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Common Mistakes</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Sending the same unaltered resume to every company.</li>
                <li>Stuffing keywords without context (ATS bots might accept it, but human recruiters won't be impressed).</li>
                <li>Overcrowding your resume with irrelevant details instead of focusing on what's most important for the role.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">2. Write a Cover Letter That Tells a Story</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters</strong><br>
            Many recruiters still view the cover letter as a peek into your personality and drive. A strong one can help you stand out in a sea of bland, generic submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How to Do It</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Show genuine enthusiasm</strong>: Open with a story or anecdote that reveals why you're excited about this role or company.</li>
                <li><strong>Tie your skills to the company's pain points</strong>: If they need strong communication skills, mention your success as a spokesperson or team leader.</li>
                <li><strong>Close with a compelling CTA</strong>: Politely invite them to discuss your fit for the role.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>AI Integration</strong><br>
            ResuSpark generates cover letters by drawing from the same data you provide for your resume, ensuring a cohesive and polished presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Common Mistakes</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Rehashing your resume in paragraph form.</li>
                <li>Using generic expressions like "I'm a team player" without backing them up.</li>
                <li>Overlooking proofreading and basic formatting.</li>
            </ul>
