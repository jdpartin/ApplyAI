Project Plan: AI-Powered Job Matching and Resume Optimization

Objective: Build a platform that generates AI-tailored resumes, evaluates job compatibility using ATS, and matches users with high-fit jobs.

Phases and Tasks

Phase 1: Research and Preparation
Research suitable ATS APIs (e.g., Sovren, RChilli, Affinda) and job search APIs (e.g., Adzuna, Jooble).
Choose the tech stack for integration (e.g., Python for backend, React for frontend).
Define data schema for:
User profiles and general resumes.
Job postings and ATS match scores.
Tailored resumes.

We will use the Adzuna job search API https://developer.adzuna.com/ for beta. Backup Option: Jooble API

We will use the Sovren ATS API for beta.
Alternative ATS APIs
RChilli:
Affordable, with a free trial available.
Provides parsing and matching but may lack Sovren’s advanced configurability.
Affinda:
Free tier available (500 documents/month).
Great for parsing but limited matching capabilities compared to Sovren.
Textkernel:
Enterprise-level, robust matching and parsing, but lacks a free tier.


Phase 2: Job Title and Search Integration
Use AI to analyze user input (resume + career goals) to generate job titles.
Integrate a job search API to fetch jobs based on the AI-generated titles.
Implement filters for user preferences (e.g., location, salary, remote options).

Phase 3: General Resume ATS Screening
Parse user resumes using an ATS API.
Run ATS match evaluation for each job fetched in Phase 2.
Store jobs with ATS match scores above a threshold (e.g., 70%).

Phase 4: AI Resume Tailoring
Use AI to generate tailored resumes for jobs with high scores from Phase 3.
Refine resumes using feedback from ATS evaluation (e.g., missing keywords).
Store tailored resumes for each job posting.

Phase 5: Tailored Resume ATS Screening
Re-run ATS match evaluation for each tailored resume.
Filter and rank jobs based on the final ATS scores (e.g., 90%+ only).

Phase 6: User Output and Feedback
Present the final list of high-match jobs to users:
Include job title, company, location, salary, and ATS match score.
Provide an option to download tailored resumes for each job.
Allow users to apply directly via the job board links.
Gather user feedback for improvements.

Timeline
Week 1–2: Research APIs, finalize tech stack, and design data schema.
Week 3–4: Implement job title generation and job search API integration.
Week 5–6: Develop general resume ATS screening and filtering logic.
Week 7–8: Implement AI resume tailoring and ATS refinement.
Week 9–10: Build user interface for job recommendations and tailored resumes.
Week 11–12: Test, optimize, and launch MVP.

Optional Features for Future Updates
Job application tracking dashboard.
AI-powered interview preparation (questions + feedback).
Multi-language support for international job seekers.
Premium subscription for unlimited ATS evaluations.
Notes:

Keep the UI simple and user-friendly.
Focus on automation to minimize user input (e.g., one-click matching and tailoring).
Ensure compliance with API terms and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
